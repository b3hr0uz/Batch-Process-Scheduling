The program mimics the execution of different processes under different scheduling algorithms.
The simulation maintains a table that reflects the current state of the system, based on choosing from a menu of choices, where each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices
are:
1) Enter parameters
2) Schedule processes with the FIFO algorithm
3) Schedule processes with the SJF algorithm
4) Schedule processes with the SRT algorithm
5) Quit the program and free memory
